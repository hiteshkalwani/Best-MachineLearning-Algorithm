# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Optimize solution

We will find the best machine learning pipeline for Titanic Dataset (reference from Kaggle) using genetic programming. You can find the dataset from [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

Here for finding the best pipeline for titanic dataset, we will use the TPOT library from Sklearn (Scikit learn). 

`TPOT` A Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.

Some libraries which are needed to run the file Titanic_prediction.ipynb. Install using following command :

> pip install matplotlib timeit sklearn pandas numpy tpot xgboost

If any modification or column drop for dataset is there, then feel free to suggest. :+1:
